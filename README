        *****************************************************

2002-01-23 HepMC was developed on Linux with gcc.
        Thanks to the work of Witold Pokorski and Pere Mato, 
        it now compiles and runs on Windows with Microsoft Visual C++. 
	To compile with Microsoft Visual C++, you need to define the 
	_WIN32 variable.

	NOTE re: linking to Pythia in the examples

Some of the files in the examples directory are aimed at showing you how
to use HepMC with Pythia. Currently it links to Pythia6.1.

Some platforms require the initialization of pythia PYDATA block 
data as external this is accomplished by the initpydata() call. If you get
pythia initialization errors try commenting in/out the initpydata()
call in the MyPythia examples.

Note the Pythia wrappers are not intended to be part of the HepMC package,
they are only provided to make the examples run.
