Although it may be possible to build the HepMC libraries from this directory,
we recommend that you create a separate build directory and work from there.

Although it may be possible to build with autotools, 
we strongly recommend building with cmake. 
Cmake is preferred for MacOSX and required for Windows.
Cmake is also required if you are using clang, or any non-gcc compiler.

Please see either INSTALL.autotools or INSTALL.cmake for directions.

The directions below explain how to build with autoconf, etc.
As of HepMC 2.06.06, you also have the option to build with cmake.
We highly recommend that you build with cmake, as explained in 
cmake/INSTALL.   Using cmake is preferred for MacOSX and Windows.
